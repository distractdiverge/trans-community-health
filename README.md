# Trans Health Research & Content Aggregator

A community-led digital platform for transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse individuals to share and preserve knowledge about hormone therapy effects on chronic conditions like hEDS, POTS, and MCAS.

## Our Vision

This project is more than a websiteâ€”it's a community-powered research initiative and living archive. We're building a digital town square where lived experience becomes validated knowledge, following the principles of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR).

## Core Principles

### 1. Community Leadership
- Led by and for transgender, nonbinary, and gender-diverse individuals
- Prioritizing leadership from TNB BIPOC community members
- Valuing emotional labor and lived experience as expertise

### 2. Ethical Framework
- Granular, ongoing, revocable consent
- Data minimization and privacy by design
- Trauma-informed approach to all interactions
- Compensation for community contributions

### 3. Knowledge Preservation
- Creating a living archive of community knowledge
- Implementing digital preservation strategies
- Ensuring accessibility across languages and abilities

## Platform Features

### Phase 1: Foundation
